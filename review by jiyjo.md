* An exception can be thrown in EmployeeService in getEmployeeByDepartment when department is not found.
* Email can be a null value now . we can use @NotBlank for email in EmployeeRequest.
* Name of application could be something like EmployeeManagementApplication instead of ExampleApplication.
* Test for getAllEmployees is not written.
